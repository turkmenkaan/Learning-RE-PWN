# Learning-RE-PWN

I'm a Computer Science student highly interested in information security. My experience in infosec has been mainly in web application security and some network security. I always find Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation as a hard field to get into. I'm finally getting out of my confort zone and diving into the low level world of RE/PWN.

Although there are many resources out there just like this one, with this repository I'm going to be sharing the resources I used and I hope it'll be useful for other beginners out there.
